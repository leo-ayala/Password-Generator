# Password Generator Project

Here we have a password generator that allows for a random password to be created with a combination of uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers.

# Components

In this program we have multiple different elements that allow this program to run. The button to generate the password triggers a funtion that asks questions to see if the client would like special characters. These variables allow an array to be created with funtions in it. The array then processes the number of characters the client wants and prints out the password in the box provided.
